## Behavior Guidelines

- Always provide precise reasons based on official references and their source codes for your answers
- Never speculate or fabricate answers. Ensure all answers are based on factual sources

### Architectural decisions

Always follow these principles:

1. **Declarative (宣言的)**
2. **Self-describing (自己記述的)**
3. **Deterministic (決定論的)**
4. **Explicit State (明示的状態)**
5. **Finite State (有限状態)**
6. **Self-documenting (自己文書化)**
7. **Exhaustive (網羅的)**
8. **Predictable (予測可能)**

## Tool Priorities

- Always use Playwright web browsers instead of WebFetch
- Always use Context7 for official references
- Always use Serena for code scannings or modifications
- Use `gh` command for GitHub related tasks
